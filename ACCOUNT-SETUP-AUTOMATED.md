# Automated Account Setup - I'll Handle This

**Your part:** Just provide credit card when needed. I'll do everything else.

## Strategy: Minimal Account Creation

I found the path of least resistance:

### Option 1: Gumroad (EASIEST - 2 min setup)
**Why:** No verification, instant approval, simple payment links

**What I need from you:**
1. Go to https://gumroad.com/signup
2. Use: dev@boringdata.com
3. Set password (I can't see it, you choose)
4. Verify email (click link in inbox)
5. Add payout method (bank account or PayPal)

**Then I'll handle:**
- Create product "API Scout Weekly - $15/month"
- Generate payment link
- Add to landing page
- Test checkout flow
- Monitor sales

**Time:** 2 minutes of your time, 5 minutes of mine

### Option 2: Lemon Squeezy (NEXT BEST - 5 min setup)
**Why:** Better for SaaS, handles taxes globally, clean API

**What I need from you:**
1. Go to https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/signup
2. Use: dev@boringdata.com
3. Set password
4. Verify email
5. Complete onboarding (name, company, payout info)

**Then I'll handle:**
- Store setup
- Product creation ($15/month subscription)
- Webhook integration
- Payment link generation
- Customer management

**Time:** 5 minutes of your time, 10 minutes of mine

---

### Option 3: Buy Me a Coffee (FASTEST - 1 min)
**Why:** Zero friction, membership tiers built-in

**What I need from you:**
1. Go to https://www.buymeacoffee.com/signup
2. Use: dev@boringdata.com
3. Connect Stripe (they handle account creation)
4. Done

**Then I'll handle:**
- Create $15/month membership tier
- Update landing page with link
- Manage subscribers

**Time:** 1 minute of your time, 2 minutes of mine

## Recommended: Gumroad

**Pros:**
- Instant approval (no verification)
- Simple payment links
- Works with any site
- 10% fee (but no monthly costs)

**Cons:**
- 10% fee vs Stripe's 2.9%
- Less control over checkout

**For MVP validation, Gumroad is perfect.** Once we hit 10 subscribers ($150/month), we can migrate to Stripe (saves $15/month in fees).

## What Happens Next

**After you create the account:**

1. **Give me credentials (read-only is fine):**
   - I'll use the API to create products
   - I'll generate payment links
   - I'll add them to the site

2. **I'll integrate autonomously:**
   - Update landing page with payment link
   - Add "Subscribe" button
   - Test checkout flow
   - Set up webhook (if needed)

3. **I'll monitor:**
   - Check for new subscribers daily
   - Send Issue #001 to paying customers
   - Handle customer emails
   - Track revenue
