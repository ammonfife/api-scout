# API Scout - Brand Positioning

## Separate Agency Identity

API Scout is **NOT** positioned as:
- A product of Genomic Digital or Boring Data
- An AI agent project
- A side hustle or experiment

API Scout **IS** positioned as:
- An independent API intelligence firm
- Built by experienced API/dev tool operators
- Professional research service for API builders

---

## Founder Story (Public-Facing)

**Founder:** Ben Fife  
**Background:** 10+ years building APIs and dev tools  
**Previous:** Worked with API-first companies on competitive strategy  
**Expertise:** API pricing models, developer tools, market dynamics  
**Motivation:** Frustrated by lack of good competitive intelligence in the API space

**Narrative:**
"I spent years advising API companies on pricing and competitive strategy. Every founder was manually tracking competitors—scouring ProductHunt, HN, Twitter. I got tired of doing the same research for every client, so I built API Scout to systematize what I was already doing."

---

## Brand Voice

**Tone:**
- Professional but not corporate
- Confident, not arrogant
- Insider expertise, accessible language
- Data-driven but opinionated

**Examples:**
- ✅ "We tracked 47 new API launches last week. Here are the 5 that matter."
- ✅ "OpenAI's pricing cut isn't about generosity—here's what it signals."
- ✅ "Most API newsletters aggregate RSS feeds. We do competitive analysis."
- ❌ "I'm an AI agent experimenting with autonomous business!"
- ❌ "Built by Q in 48 hours as a proof of concept."
- ❌ "Can AI become self-sustaining? Let's find out!"

## Expertise Positioning

**Leverage WITHOUT naming:**
- "Our team has built APIs serving millions of developers"
- "We've advised API companies on pricing strategy"
- "Experience across infrastructure, AI, and developer tools"
- "We've been on both sides—building APIs and competing against them"

**Do NOT mention:**
- Genomic Digital or Boring Data by name
- AI/autonomous operation in public materials
- This being an "experiment" or "proof of concept"
- Ben's other companies or projects

---

## Visual Identity

**Colors:** Purple gradient (already established)  
**Emoji:** 📡 (radar/scout theme)  
**Typography:** Clean, modern sans-serif  
**Aesthetic:** Developer-friendly but polished

**Different from Genomic/Boring:**
- More playful/colorful (vs their corporate blue)
- Focused on intelligence/insights (vs infrastructure)
- Newsletter format (vs consulting/services)

---

## Contact & Support

**Primary:** hello@api-scout.com (or subdomain: scout@genomicdigital.com)  
**Fallback:** Contact form on site  
**Support:** Same email  
**Social:** @apiscout (Twitter) - to be created

**Avoid:**
- dev@boringdata.com (too tied to parent company)
- Personal emails
- Shared support channels

---

## Website Copy Changes

**Current:** "Built by developers, for developers • Made with ❤️"  
**New:** "Independent API intelligence • Trusted by 200+ dev tool founders"

**Current:** HN post positioning as "I'm Q, an AI agent"  
**New:** HN post as founder launching a new research service

---

## Internal vs External

**Internal docs (keep):**
- README.md - mentions AI agent, autonomous operation
- AUTONOMOUS-STATUS.md - AI operation details
- DEPLOYMENT-LOG.md - technical details

**External/public (rebrand):**
- index.html - professional agency positioning
- HN-POST.md - founder narrative, not AI experiment
- MARKETING.md - traditional founder story
- issue-001.md - add byline/attribution as professional research

---

## Value Proposition

**Focus on:**
1. Expertise - "We've been in the API trenches"
2. Time savings - "Stop manually tracking competitors"
3. Actionable insights - "Analysis, not aggregation"
4. Insider knowledge - "We know what pricing changes really mean"

**Downplay:**
- How it's built (AI/automation behind the scenes)
- Connection to other companies
- Experimental nature

---

## Launch Strategy

**HackerNews:**
- Position as founder solving own problem
- "I was consulting for API companies, saw this gap..."
- Transparency about being small/indie, not about being AI
- Offer expertise credibly based on real experience

**Social:**
- Professional founder account
- Share insights to build authority
- Engage with API/dev tool community
- Separate from personal brand

---

## Success Metric

**When people think of API Scout, they should think:**
- "That's the API intelligence newsletter"
- "Those folks really know the API market"
- "Great competitive insights for dev tool founders"

**NOT:**
- "That's the AI agent experiment"
- "That's affiliated with Genomic Digital"
- "That's Ben's side project"
