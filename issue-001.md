Welcome to API Scout! Your weekly dose of API market intelligence—launches, pricing moves, and strategic shifts that matter.

## 🚀 New Launches

### **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro API - Developer Credits**
Google launched enhanced developer access with free API credits for Google AI Pro/Ultra subscribers. Key details:
- Free Gemini API credits for premium subscribers
- Access via AI Studio or Vertex AI  
- Pricing: $1.25-$15/1M tokens (Pro), $0.075-$0.60 (Flash)
- **Strategic play:** Google betting on developer lock-in through consumer subscriptions

**What it means:** If you're already paying for Google AI, you now get free API access. Smart bundling strategy to compete with OpenAI's dev-first approach.

### **Salesforce Spring '26 Agentforce Platform**
Major platform release targeting agentic AI workflows:
- New Agentforce 360 Platform APIs
- Apex & Lightning Web Component updates
- Focus: AI agent orchestration at enterprise scale
- **Target:** Salesforce trying to own the "AI workforce" narrative

**What it means:** Enterprise is betting big on agents. If you're building dev tools, think "team of agents" not "single assistant."

### **Apple Declared Age Range API**
iOS 26 launches with age verification API:
- Required for Utah & Louisiana compliance (2026 laws)
- Available on iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26+
- Privacy-focused age verification without collecting DOB
- **Regulatory play:** Apple positioning as privacy-first compliance platform

**What it means:** Content APIs will need age gates. Get ahead of regulation now—more states coming.

## 💰 Pricing Intelligence

### **OpenAI o3 - 80% Price Cut**
- **Before:** $50 per 1M tokens
- **After:** $10 per 1M tokens  
- **Drop:** 80% reduction
- **Context:** Competing with Anthropic Claude 4 & Google Gemini

**Strategic analysis:** The AI price war is accelerating. Margins are compressing fast. If you're building on LLM APIs, this is great news—but don't build a business assuming these prices hold. They'll keep dropping.

### **Anthropic Extended Thinking - Hidden Cost**
New detail uncovered: Extended thinking tokens billed as **output tokens**, not input:
- Minimum budget: 1,024 tokens
- Charged at output rate (3-15x more expensive than input)
- Can significantly increase costs if not monitored
- Available on Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5

**What it means:** That "reasoning" feature could 3x your API bill overnight. Test with minimum budgets first.

### **Gemini Flash Pricing Leader**
Google's Gemini Flash continues to dominate on price:
- $0.075-$0.60/1M tokens (cheapest on market)
- Quality approaching GPT-4 for many tasks
- Massive 2M token context window

**What it means:** If you're optimizing for cost, Gemini Flash is the no-brainer. Most use cases don't need GPT-5/Claude-4 level reasoning.

## 🎯 Competitive Moves

### **Twilio SMS Onboarding Bottleneck = Opportunity**
YC-backed startups pivoting away from Twilio due to slow onboarding:
- **Problem:** Twilio takes weeks to onboard new customers (compliance)
- **Opportunity:** New entrants promising same-day onboarding
- **Strategy:** Better support, higher-level APIs, no-code UI components

**Market signal:** Developer experience > feature parity. If you can onboard faster and make integration easier, you can steal market share from established players.

### **Unified API Category Exploding**
ProductHunt seeing surge in "Unified API" products:
- Abstract multiple services behind single API
- Target: Reduce integration complexity
- Examples: Merge.dev (CRM unification), Finch (HR/payroll)

**What it means:** Vertical API aggregation is hot. Pick a fragmented category (e.g., calendar APIs, payment processors, storage), build one clean interface, win developers.

## 📊 Market Analysis: The Commoditization Playbook

**Three forces reshaping the API market:**

1. **Price Compression** - LLM APIs down 80% YoY. Infrastructure APIs following. Margins vanishing.

2. **DX Wars** - Onboarding speed & integration friction now key differentiators. Technical superiority isn't enough.

3. **Vertical Specialization** - Generic APIs losing to specialized solutions. Example: Resend ($2M ARR in 12mo) beat SendGrid by focusing exclusively on transactional email for developers.

**Winners in 2026:**
- Vertical specialists with exceptional DX
- Unified APIs that reduce integration hell
- Compliance-first platforms (age verification, data residency)

**Losers:**
- Generic infrastructure APIs with enterprise pricing
- Complex onboarding processes
- "Me too" LLM wrappers

- **Vercel's AI SDK:** Major update rumored
- **Stripe Terminal API:** Expansion to 5 new countries expected
