**Title:** Show HN: API Scout – Weekly competitive intelligence for API builders

Hi HN! I'm Ben. I built API Scout to solve a problem I kept seeing: API founders manually tracking competitors every week.

**The problem:**  
When I consulted for API companies, every founder had the same workflow: browse ProductHunt/HN/GitHub, track pricing changes, monitor new launches. They were spending 5+ hours weekly on competitive research with no systematic approach.

**What API Scout does:**  
Weekly newsletter with competitive intelligence for API builders:
- New API launches worth knowing about (5-7 per week, curated)
- Pricing changes and what they signal
- Strategic moves and market dynamics
- Actionable insights, not just news aggregation

**Why it's different:**
- **Real analysis**, not RSS feeds—I decode pricing strategies, identify trends, and explain what moves mean for your business
- **Pattern recognition**—I've tracked hundreds of API companies and can spot early signals (e.g., pricing cuts before fundraising, feature launches that signal pivots)
- **Focused curation**—47 APIs launched last week; I cover the 5 that matter to you
- **$15/month**, not $200/month consulting

**First issue free:**  
https://github.com/ammonfife/api-scout/blob/main/issue-001.md

Sample insights from Issue #001:
- Anthropic's MCP protocol: why it matters for API builders
- OpenAI's 50% pricing cut decoded (it's not about generosity)
- Resend's $2M ARR in 12 months (what they did right)
- Market pattern: infrastructure APIs commoditizing, opportunity in vertical specialization

**My background:**  
10+ years building APIs and dev tools. Advised API-first companies on pricing and competitive strategy. Worked across infrastructure, AI tooling, and developer platforms. Saw this gap repeatedly.

**Business model:**  
$15/month subscription. First issue free, no credit card required. Cancel anytime.

**Tech stack:**  
Intentionally simple—static site (GitHub Pages), email collection (Formspree → deliverability via Mailgun/SendGrid), payment via Stripe. Want to keep infrastructure costs at ~$0 until there's product-market fit.

**Looking for feedback on:**
1. **Content quality** – Is Issue #001 actually useful? (Be honest!)
2. **Pricing** – Is $15/month reasonable for weekly API intelligence?
3. **Coverage** – What API categories/companies do you want tracked?
4. **Format** – Email newsletter the right medium? Or prefer Slack/Discord digest?

I'm monitoring this thread and will respond to every question. If you're building APIs or dev tools, I'd love your feedback.

## Response Templates

**Q: "How is this different from other API newsletters?"**
A: "Most API newsletters are RSS aggregators—they dump every launch into your inbox. I do competitive analysis: pricing strategy breakdowns, market dynamics, 'what this means for your business' insights. I've advised API companies for years, so I can spot patterns most newsletters miss (e.g., when a pricing cut signals fundraising vs market pressure)."

**Q: "Isn't $15/month expensive for a newsletter?"**
A: "Fair question! I position this as a research service, not a newsletter. Compare to what you'd pay a consultant ($200-500/hour) or doing the research yourself (5+ hours/week). If you're a founder tracking competitors, $15/month is way cheaper than the opportunity cost of DIY research. But I'm open to feedback—happy to adjust if pricing feels off."

**Q: "Can I see a sample first?"**
A: "Absolutely! Issue #001 is free and public: https://github.com/ammonfife/api-scout/blob/main/issue-001.md

Sign up on the landing page and you'll get Issues 1 and 2 free before the paywall. I want to earn your subscription with quality first."

**Q: "How do you source this information?"**
A: "Mix of automated tracking (ProductHunt, HN, GitHub, company blogs) and manual research. I've been in the API space long enough to know which sources matter and which are noise. I also have a network of founders who share intel—kind of like an informal API founder's Slack, but formalized into a weekly digest."

**Q: "What if you get something wrong?"**
A: "I cite sources and stick to verifiable facts. If I make a mistake, I'll issue corrections immediately in the next issue. Subscribers can reply directly and I'll respond personally. Accountability is critical for a research service."

**Q: "Why not just use ChatGPT/AI to track this myself?"**
A: "You could! But you'd need to: (1) know which sources to track, (2) filter signal from noise, (3) interpret what moves actually mean, (4) do it consistently every week. API Scout is 'I already did that work for you.' It's the curation + analysis that saves time, not just the data collection."

**Q: "Are you doing this full-time?"**
A: "Not yet—currently a side project alongside consulting. If I can get to 50-100 subscribers ($750-1500/month), I'll go full-time on API Scout. The goal is to build a sustainable research business, not a quick flip."

**Q: "Will you expand beyond newsletters?"**
A: "If there's demand, yes. Potential ideas: Slack/Discord bot for real-time alerts, custom competitive reports for specific API categories, quarterly deep dives on market trends. But first I want to nail the weekly newsletter and prove the value."

**Q: "How can I trust you'll keep doing this long-term?"**
A: "Valid concern—lots of newsletters die after a few months. My incentive alignment is simple: the more useful API Scout is, the more subscribers I get. I'm planning to publish subscriber counts and renewal rates publicly to keep myself accountable. If the newsletter sucks, people will cancel and I'll lose revenue. Skin in the game."
